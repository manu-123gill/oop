## Object Oriented Program
Java ,c,c++and python is object orinted language. Object oriented is the concept of classes and objects.In object oriented one class consists many object like as a food class. 
Potatoes ,rice and beans are the objects of food class. The feature of object oriented language is Encapsulation, Abstraction , inheritance ,polmerphism use. 
Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. Fuctions operate the data ana variable stored the data.

# Inheritance: 
inheritance allow user to define a class that inherits all the methed and Properties. In inheritance user uses more classes. But there is only one main class.
Main class is also called patent class and other class is called base class.When user uses more that one main class,it is called multipal inhetitance.
# Example
 class Kitkat extand Food {
 
   public Kitkat(int supply) {
   
     super(supply):
  }   
 public void consume(int amount){
 
   this.supply -= 2* amount;
   
   }
   
   }
   in example super allow Kitkat to call the Food constractor
   
   food constructor fills food properties

   # Encapsulation
   By using encspsulation, we can restrict the variable and method assess globally by making it private.
   1. Declare the class variable as a private.
   2. Declare the class method as a public.
